# CannonGame SpaceInvadersVariation
https://github.com/CuriousPan/CannonGame-SpaceInvadersVariation

This is a variation of Space Invaders written in Python using pygame. The name of the game "All king's Vodka" was inspired by book All the king's Men of American writer Robert Penn Warren.
The game has several references to other games and media culture. 

To move the cannon player can use A and D buttons and the mouse.
Try it and enjoy(I hope so).

P.S. If you face any bug don't hesitate notifying me and doing pull-requests.
